Things you may want to cover:


Welcome to my Capstone project/Apartment App.  The focus on this project was was to create a full stack, tenant-driven environment. 
 When a user visits https://apartment-app-jfxo.onrender.com/, they can either login with a Username & Password that they have already saved to the database, or they can click the link to signup to create a profile and gain access. The profile creation is only accessible to tenants of the building, as a Lease is needed in order to complete signup.
  After gainging access, they are welcomed home to a list of individual apartments as well as a link to view their lease.
   Each apartment has a reviews section that can be viewed, but only tenants can add a review.  When a review is submitted, only the tenant who created it can edit or remove it.
